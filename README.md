# Weather_station
A weather station is a device that collects data related to the weather & environment using different sensors. There are two types of weather stations, one which is having own sensors and the second type of weather station is where we pull data from the weather station servers. Weather station sensors may include a thermometer to take temperature readings, a barometer to measure the atmospheric pressure, Hygrometer to measure humidity, rain sensor to measure rainfall, an anemometer to measure wind speed, and more. Weather stations are also called weather centers, personal weather stations, professional weather stations, home weather stations, weather forecaster, and forecasters.
The interface includes DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor, BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor, and FC37 Rain Sensor with NodeMCU ESP8266-12E Wifi Module. We will measure humidity, temperature, Barometric pressure, and rainfall and upload the data to a web server. Once the code is uploaded you can find the IP address of NodeMCU in the serial monitor. With the same IP, you can go to any web browser and display the data in a widget format.
